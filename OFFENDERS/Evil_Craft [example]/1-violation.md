#Evil Craft

## List of shortcomings

* does not provide a link to the original Minetest project
* does not attribute original authors of code for `silly_animals` (GPLv2), `great_machines` (CC-BY-SA 4)
* uses the work of "Minesim" made by "Echoes91"
	* https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=14732&hilit=minesim

## Corrective actions required

* Attribute Minetest in relevant descriptions
* Attribute great machines
* Remove Silly Animals and suggest replacement mobs more animals

## Steps if declined to comply

* Notify Silly Animals author to contact Play Store to report a license violation on the app
* Notify Great Machines author to contact Play Store to report a license violation on the app
* Notify Minesim author to contact Play Store to report a license violation on the app

Additionally

* Notify Minetest core dev team to contact Play Store to report a license violation on the app
* provide communications transcript URL to Minetest devs for use in the report
