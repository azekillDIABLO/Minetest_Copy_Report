Subject: [Evil Craft] Please correct your app description

Hello Evilcrafter,

Thank you for using Minetest as the engine for your game Evilcraft.

As you may know, Minetest is a community-driven effort to create an awesome game engine to base voxel games off of for anyone!

However, we should note that it is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1, and your app description and about sections do not comply with the license's requirements:

You must prominently state in the description and documentation (including general About sections in-app) that

    - the app uses Minetest as its engine
    - the app uses the following mods:
      - silly_animals by Modder1, licensed under GPLv2
      - great_machines by Modder2, licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0

Additionally, the game carries textures created by a third party, licensed separately

You must prominently state in the description and documentation (including general About sections in-app) that

    - the app uses the SuperTextures texture pack by MTDesigner123 , licensed under CC-BY 3.0

I hope you understand that as a community, we wish for anybody to be able to create great games with Minetest and resources from the community, and that the Minetest community as a whole should receive the appropriate recognition.

Thank you
