This was only an unconfirmed claim by a single user in early May 2016. More information is needed:

1. Find out if the official, legal Google Play store was being used (as per MineYoshi's guesses)
2. If this "Google Play store" was counterfeit, or the app was obtained from a third-party app store like Aptoide (as per MineYoshi's 
   guesses)
3. Find out if there was a counterfeit "Minecraft" app which was taken down by the Minecraft trademark holders in May 2016 or later.
4. Find out if this counterfeit "Minecraft" ever existed at all. The user stated it was called "Minecraft" and not Minetest, even after
   being given the names of possible Minetest clones. However, it may have been confusion on part of the user, both times they were asked.

Possible solutions:

1. If the app is proven to exist, report the counterfeit software to the Minecraft trademark holders.
2. If the app is proven to exist, ask Google about possible transactions related to the app, including purchases of its "full version".
3. Continue to encourage users, especially mobile users who are most affected by these scams, to download the 
   official Minetest clients on minetest.net.
