Hi,

Tonight, someone on my server:

1. Stated that he was receiving popup ads and videos during play
2. Mentioned that he was using a tablet and received the game via Google Play
3. Stated that he was going to buy a laptop so he could "purchase the full game"

But, most importantly,

HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF MINETEST!

He thought he was playing Minecraft!

I took a quick glance at Google Play and there is a lot of stuff there relating to Minecraft. Perhaps one of them is an illegally rebranded Minetest.

Has anyone run into this scam?

        Or Cartooncraft?



    I asked him if the game went under either of those names, and he said it wasn't, it was called "Minecraft"


"Aptoide"...
But when i remember he says is from "Google Play" i don't know...
i don't know, anyways that's ILLEGAL and i don't know from where that app come...
Or in an alternative case:
-The "Google Play" isn't the official one, it's a FAKE "Google Play"...

I don't think someone can be so innocent to don't realize it's a fake "MineCraft", anyways (without want to offend someone) he should be a
casual user, or a little kid (maybe) and probably he don't know so much about the Internet and the risks of downloading some
"Minecrafts"...
If he wants to play Minecraft (ok, better play Minetest) he should buy it at the real Google Play!
Or he wants to test a beta, that's other way to play it, but that betas, normally have many bugs and problems!
