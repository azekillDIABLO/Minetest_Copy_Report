# Minetest_Copy_Report
In this you can REPORT EVRY ABUSIVE MINETEST COPY! :D Finally some justice in this world!

###**First Step:**

To report an app, go to the issue tracker and create a new topic which should be named like that:

**OFFENDER:"full name of the app| ex: my-crafty-test"**

Do not put abbreviations of the name like "MCA" >>> "minecraft_alpha" or "SCT" >>> "SUPER-CRAFT-TEST"

###**Second Step:**

Do a clear description of the abusive copy, what is wrong and remember to put a link to the app download and also the main site if there is one. If you have conclusive screenshots, which prove that the game is a copy of minetest, or a game using ***ilegally*** some stuff from our comunnity, post them! It will help the admin to see if the app is doing bad things!

One important thing is, that even if the app is an obvious copy, ***you must not spam or insult the people who worked on it!*** They probably don't know the license and, if they purpose free downloads of the game, they didn't done this for money.

###**Third Step:**

Wait for answers. Remember that the admin is only a human, with two hands, one brain (or less) and with a social life. Also, comments and solution will not be what you are waiting for. We are sorry of this, but we are ***pacific***. We will try to resolve the problem by talking and finding a good solution.

##**On this, let's hunt abusive apps! :D**
