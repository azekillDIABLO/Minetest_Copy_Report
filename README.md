# Minetest_Copy_Report
In this you can REPORT EVRY ABUSIVE MINETEST COPY! :D Finally some justice in this world!

### **First Step:**

On Github.com, create an account -free- if you don't have already one

Come back to the main page for this repository and click the "Fork" button in the top right

In your copy, in the top right, create a new "branch". Give it a clear name which should look like :

***"Your_Username":"Full_Name_of_the_app"***

###**Second Step:**

On your copy, build a new file called by the name of the app in *'projects'>>>'offenders'*

In this file, add:
* a file called "violations.txt" where you will put what you find wrong on the app you report
        
* a file called "solutions.txt" where you explain what you think to do, to resolve the problem
        
* screenshots if you have some. They must prove that the game is a copy of minetest, or a game using ***ilegally*** some stuff from our comunnity? It will help the admin to see if the app is doing bad things!
                
* a "note.txt" if you have important things to say

they can be in another format than *.txt* like *.md* or *.odt* Please don't use "microsoft only" formats. On most computer, they are unreadable, and you need to download or buy an app to read them. Also you can put a *.pdf* file, if you don't have other ways to do it.

Click the button "Make Pull Request" to send us your changes. 

###**Third Step:**

Wait for answers. One important thing is, that even if the app is an obvious copy, ***you must not spam or insult the people who worked on it!*** They probably don't know the license and, if they purpose free downloads of the game, they didn't done this for money. Remember that the admin is only a human, with two hands, one brain (or less) and with a social life. Also, comments and solution will not be what you are waiting for. We are sorry of this, but we are ***pacific***. We will try to resolve the problem by talking and finding a good solution.

##**On this, let's hunt abusive apps! :D**
